Based on heavily modified code https://github.com/onimahoni/PicoMate

My code extension allows:

- launch editor for individual files
- show file size and modification time
- show running clock
- show battery level
- show preview of first line of file in status line
- use two types of screensaver (matrix - taken from https://github.com/LennartHennigs/PicoCalc-Notes/blob/main/src/matrix.bas and simple floating clock)

...and all other features that the original launcher had.

Of course it is still in development. Right now I am working on sorting files by name / size / modification date.
